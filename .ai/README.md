# AI Runtime Governance

This directory contains the project-level governance runtime for AI coding agents.

It is intended to be loaded selectively by adapters, workflows, and task routing rules instead of being copied into one large prompt.

## Structure

- `constitution/` - stable philosophy and long-term principles.
- `invariants/` - rules that must not be violated.
- `policies/` - operational constraints and permissions.
- `router/` - task classification, risk levels, and loading rules.
- `skills/` - reusable operational procedures.
- `workflows/` - task-specific execution loops.
- `checklists/` - self-review and recall mechanisms.
- `evaluation/` - feedback criteria and governance quality review.
- `state/` - explicit control-system state, not hidden agent memory.
- `adapters/` - entry guidance for specific agent runtimes.
